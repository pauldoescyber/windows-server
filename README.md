# windows-server Project Description
This projects involves setting up a windows server on your virtual machine using oracle virtual box. The windows server can then be configured for DNS services , DHCP, AD DS and many more things. In the project linked here we follow through similar steps  but we configure the server for many of these services and also create a domain of 
users that will use the server we have set up for DNS, DHCP amongst other services. For this project however we will review how to set up the windows server on oracle virtual box.
